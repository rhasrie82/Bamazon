# Bamazon
Node.js &amp; MySQL Homework

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

In this screenshot, we see the first half of the table of item including the Item Number, the product description, the price, and the dpeartment that it is in.

In this screenshot, we see the second half of the list and the prompt asks what item the user plans to purchase from the store. Afer the user chooses the item, the prompt asks how much of that item, the user plans to purchase.

After the user chooses his/her quantity, we add the total of the item price and the quantity of the items purchased.

Just in case the user plans to purchase an item and we do not have the quantity in our database. He/she is given a message that the item is sold out.
